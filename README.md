# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game
Project Overview

This is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows two players to take turns marking spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. The objective is to get three marks in a row, column, or diagonal.

Key Features

âœ… Interactive Gameplay â€“ Players take turns marking X and O in the grid.
âœ… Win Detection â€“ The game checks for a winner after every move.
âœ… Disable Board on Win â€“ Once a player wins, further moves are disabled.
âœ… Reset Functionality â€“ The game can be reset at any time.
âœ… Responsive Design â€“ The game adapts to different screen sizes.
âœ… Winner Announcement â€“ A pop-up message announces the winner.

Technologies Used

HTML5 â€“ Structuring the game board and UI.

CSS3 â€“ Styling the game layout, buttons, and winner message.

JavaScript (ES6) â€“ Handling game logic, turn switching, and winner detection.

Code Structure

Tic-Tac-Toe/
â”‚â”€â”€ index.html  # Main HTML file
â”‚â”€â”€ style.css   # CSS for styling
â”‚â”€â”€ app.js      # JavaScript for game logic

How It Works

The HTML file defines the structure with buttons for the grid and control buttons.

The CSS file styles the game using Flexbox for layout and visual effects.

The JavaScript file:

Listens for button clicks to mark X or O.

Checks for a winner after each move.

Disables further moves if a winner is found.

Displays a winner message and allows resetting the game.
