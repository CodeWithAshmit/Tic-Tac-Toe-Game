# 🎮 Tic-Tac-Toe Game

## 📝 **Project Overview**
This is a simple **Tic-Tac-Toe** game built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. The game allows two players to take turns marking spaces in a **3×3 grid**. The objective is to get **three marks in a row, column, or diagonal**.

## ⭐ **Key Features**

🔹 **Interactive Gameplay** – Players take turns marking **❌ X** and **⭕ O** in the grid.

🔹 **Win Detection** – The game automatically checks for a **winner** after every move.

🔹 **Disable Board on Win** – Once a player **wins**, further moves are **disabled**.

🔹 **Reset Functionality** – The game can be **reset at any time** to start fresh.

🔹 **Responsive Design** – The game **adapts** to different screen sizes.

🔹 **Winner Announcement** – A **pop-up message** announces the winner.

## 🛠 **Technologies Used**

✅ **HTML5** – Structuring the game board and UI.

✅ **CSS3** – Styling the game layout, buttons, and winner message.

✅ **JavaScript (ES6)** – Handling game logic, turn switching, and winner detection.
